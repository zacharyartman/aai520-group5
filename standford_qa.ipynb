      "Input: Context: The Rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine. The cycle is an arrangement of components as is typically used for simple power production, and utilizes the phase change of water (boiling water producing steam, condensing exhaust steam, producing liquid water)) to provide a practical heat/power conversion system. The heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser. The Rankine cycle is used in virtually all steam power production applications. In the 1990s, Rankine steam cycles generated about 90% of all electric power used throughout the world, including virtually all solar, biomass, coal and nuclear power plants. It is named after William John Macquorn Rankine, a Scottish polymath. Question: What happens to waste heat in the Rankine cycle? Answer:\n",

The law requires that the GP practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified, minimum distance (currently 1.6 kilometres) between a patient's home and the nearest retail pharmacy. This law also exists in Austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away, or where none is registered in the city.

The Jameel Gallery of Islamic Art, opened in 2006, houses a representative display of 400 objects with the highlight being the Ardabil Carpet, the centrepiece of the gallery. The displays in this gallery cover objects from Spain, North Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and Afghanistan. A masterpiece of Islamic art is a 10th-century Rock crystal ewer. Many examples of Qur'āns with exquisite calligraphy dating from various periods are on display. A 15th-century minbar from a Cairo mosque with ivory forming complex geometrical patterns inlaid in wood is one of the larger objects on display. Extensive examples of ceramics especially Iznik pottery, glasswork including 14th-century lamps from mosques and metalwork are on display. The collection of Middle Eastern and Persian rugs and carpets is amongst the finest in the world, many were part of the Salting Bequest of 1909. Examples of tile work from various buildings including a fireplace dated 1731 from Istanbul made of intricately decorated blue and white tiles and turquoise tiles from the exterior of buildings from Samarkand are also displayed.

Before Newton, the tendency for objects to fall towards the Earth was not understood to be related to the motions of celestial objects. Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as  and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth. This observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the Earth's surface is directly proportional to the object's mass. Thus an object that has a mass of  will experience a force: Question: Where was the measurment for the standard gravity on Earth taken? Answer:\n",

    "### Methodology\n",
    "The task involved fine-tuning a T5-based model for question answering using a dataset containing contexts, questions, and answers. The steps for training and evaluation were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A JSON dataset was processed and flattened to extract contexts, questions, and answers.\n",
    "- The data was further split into training and validation sets, where each row contained an input_text (combining context and question) and a target (answer1).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model and Tokenization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The T5Tokenizer and T5ForConditionalGeneration model were used from the Hugging Face transformers library.\n",
    "Both the training and validation datasets were tokenized, with inputs truncated to a maximum length of 512 tokens and target sequences to 64 tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Setup and Training: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Trainer class was employed for training, using a batch size of 4, with evaluation strategy set to run every 10 steps. Training was resumed from a checkpoint.\n",
    "The model was trained for 1 epoch with num_train_epochs=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- We evaluated the model was evaluated using the validation dataset after training, calculating the loss and checking predictions against actual answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "- Evaluation Loss: The model achieved a very low evaluation loss of 0.029.\n",
    "- Efficiency: The model processed 29.92 samples per second and 7.49 steps per second during evaluation.\n",
    "- Example Prediction: On one sample from the validation set, the model was given the context of the Rankine cycle and asked, \"What happens to waste heat in the Rankine cycle?\"\n",
    "  - Predicted Answer: \"removed in a condenser\"\n",
    "  - Actual Answer: \"removed in a condenser\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's performance on this example was highly accurate, demonstrating effective learning and prediction capabilities for T5 model for the question-answering task.\n"
